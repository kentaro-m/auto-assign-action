# Auto Assign Action
An action which adds reviewers to the pull request when the pull request is opened.

## :arrow_forward: Usage
Create a workflow (e.g. `.github/workflows/action.yml` For more detail, refer to [Configuring a workflow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file)) for running the auto-assign action.

```yml
name: 'Auto Assign'
on:
  pull_request
    types: [opened, ready_for_review]

jobs:
  add-reviews:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: kentaro-m/auto-assign-action@v1.1.2
        with:
          configuration-path: ".github/some_name_for_configs.yml" # Only needed if you use something other than .github/auto_assign.yml
```

Create a separate configuration file for the auto-assign action (e.g. `.github/auto_assign.yml`).

### Single Reviewers List
Add reviewers/assignees to the pull request based on single reviewers list.

```yaml
# Set to true to add reviewers to pull requests
addReviewers: true

# Set to true to add assignees to pull requests
addAssignees: false

# A list of reviewers to be added to pull requests (GitHub user name)
reviewers:
  - reviewerA
  - reviewerB
  - reviewerC

# A number of reviewers added to the pull request
# Set 0 to add all the reviewers (default: 0)
numberOfReviewers: 0

# A list of assignees, overrides reviewers if set
# assignees:
#   - assigneeA

# A number of assignees to add to the pull request
# Set to 0 to add all of the assignees.
# Uses numberOfReviewers if unset.
# numberOfAssignees: 2

# A list of keywords to be skipped the process that add reviewers if pull requests include it
# skipKeywords:
#   - wip
```

### Multiple Reviewers List
Add reviewers/assignees to the pull request based on multiple reviewers list.

If you and peers work at the separate office or they work at the separate team by roles like frontend and backend, you might be good to use adding reviewers from each group.

```yaml
# Set to true to add reviewers to pull requests
addReviewers: true

# Set to true to add assignees to pull requests
addAssignees: false

# A number of reviewers added to the pull request
# Set 0 to add all the reviewers (default: 0)
numberOfReviewers: 1

# A number of assignees to add to the pull request
# Set to 0 to add all of the assignees.
# Uses numberOfReviewers if unset.
# numberOfAssignees: 2

# Set to true to add reviewers from different groups to pull requests
useReviewGroups: true

# A list of reviewers, split into different groups, to be added to pull requests (GitHub user name)
reviewGroups:
  groupA:
    - reviewerA
    - reviewerB
    - reviewerC
  groupB:
    - reviewerD
    - reviewerE
    - reviewerF

# Set to true to add assignees from different groups to pull requests
useAssigneeGroups: false

# A list of assignees, split into different froups, to be added to pull requests (GitHub user name)
# assigneeGroups:
#   groupA:
#     - assigneeA
#     - assigneeB
#     - assigneeC
#   groupB:
#     - assigneeD
#     - assigneeE
#     - assigneeF

# A list of keywords to be skipped the process that add reviewers if pull requests include it
# skipKeywords:
#   - wip
```

### Assign Author as Assignee
Add the PR creator as the assignee of the pull request.

```yaml
# Set addAssignees to 'author' to set the PR creator as the assignee.
addAssignees: author
```

### Filter by label
The action will only run if the PR meets the specified filters

```yaml
filterLabels:
  # Run
  include:
    - my_label
    - another_label
  # Not run
  exclude:
    - wip

```
